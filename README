General Installation
Extract the zip to the following directory on your hard-drive:

<Steam-directory>/steamapps/<Username>/garrysmod/garrysmod/gamemodes/

Running a Listen Server
Browse to the below directory and edit the sh_config.lua file to your liking.

<Steam-directory>/steamapps/<Username>/garrysmod/garrysmod/gamemodes/prop_hunt/gamemode

Lastly, start up Garry’s Mod and click Create Multiplayer at the main menu. Select the map of your choice and then click the Options tab. Set the Default Gamemode option to prop-hunt. Set any other options you’d like and then click the Start Game button at the bottom.

Running a Dedicated Server
Browse to the below directory and edit the sh_config.lua file to your liking.

<Steam-directory>/steamapps/<Username>/garrysmod/garrysmod/gamemodes/prop_hunt/gamemode

Once your done, upload the entire prop-hunt folder to the following location on your server.

<SRCDS directory>/orangebox/garrysmod/gamemodes/

Next you’ll need to set the default gamemode to run when your server starts up. Browse to the following directory and open up the game.cfg file with NotePad.

<SRCDS directory>/orangebox/garrysmod/cfg/

Add the following console command to the cfg file:

sv_defaultgamemode "prop_hunt"

Alternatively, you can leave the default gamemode as sandbox and switch to Prop Hunt on the fly with this console command:

rcon changegamemode [map] prop_hunt

You can switch back to sandbox anytime with this command:

rcon changegamemode [map] sandbox

You’ll need to restart your server before the above commands/changes will work. Don’t forget to run “scriptenforce_createmanifest” and “sv_scriptenforcerenabled 1″ to prevent against Lua cheats/hacks.
