# Installation

For the majority of users the easiest way to install is by adding the gamemode from [the official Steam Workshop page](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=135509255&searchtext=Prop+Hunt).

If you wish to install manually, you can clone via Git from this repository. This will allow you to test the latest and greatest code, and - if you fork to your own space on GitHub - contribute back to the project.


# Creating a Server

From the Garry's Mod game simply select the gamemode from the dropdown in the bottom right after you have installed. From there, create a server as you normally would.
