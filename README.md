# Installation

For the majority of users the easiest way to install is by adding the gamemode from [this unofficial Steam Workshop page](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=135509255&searchtext=Prop+Hunt).

If you wish to install manually, you can clone this repository using Git. This will allow you to test the latest and greatest code, and - if you fork to your own space on GitHub - contribute back to the project.

**You should note this repository is not yet compatible with the latest Garry's Mod. Downloading from the unofficial workshop page listed above is recommended at this time.**


# Creating a Server

After you have installed, launch Garry's Mod and select the Prop Hunt gamemode from the dropdown in the bottom right. From there, create a server as you normally would.
